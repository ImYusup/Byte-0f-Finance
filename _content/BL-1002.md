## What is Ethereum? {#What-is-Ethereum}

Ethereum (ETH) is a decentralized, open-source blockchain that introduced smart contracts‚Äîprogrammable code that runs on the blockchain. Proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, Ethereum enables developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on its platform.

Unlike Bitcoin, which mainly functions as digital gold, Ethereum aims to be a **world computer**‚Äîhosting DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and more. It is the infrastructure layer for much of the Web3 ecosystem.

## A Brief History of Ethereum {#A-Brief-History-of-Ethereum}

- **2013:** Vitalik Buterin proposes Ethereum whitepaper.
- **2015:** Ethereum mainnet goes live.
- **2017:** The ICO boom runs on Ethereum, ETH reaches $1,400.
- **2020:** Launch of DeFi Summer; Uniswap, Compound, and others explode.
- **2021:** NFTs dominate the market; ETH hits new highs near $4,800.
- **2022:** The Merge‚ÄîEthereum shifts from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS).
- **2023‚Äì2024:** Ethereum continues scaling through Layer 2 (L2) rollups and dominates in total value locked (TVL) in DeFi.

You can accumulate ETH using various strategies:

1. **Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA):** Purchase ETH regularly with a fixed amount.
2. **Use Trusted Exchanges:** Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and other secure platforms.
3. **Store Securely:** Use hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) or non-custodial wallets like MetaMask.
4. **Long-Term Holding:** Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem is vast‚Äîholding ETH is like owning part of the Web3 backbone.

## ETH Yield Opportunities (Staking & DeFi) {#ETH-Yield-Opportunities}

ETH holders can earn passive income through:

- **Staking ETH:** Stake directly (if you have 32 ETH) or use platforms like Lido, RocketPool, or centralized exchanges (Coinbase, Binance).
- **DeFi Lending/Borrowing:** Lend ETH on Aave, Compound, or Morpho.
- **Liquidity Providing:** Provide ETH in pools like Uniswap, Curve, or Balancer for trading fees.
- **Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs):** Tokens like stETH (Lido) or rETH (RocketPool) allow earning yield while staying liquid.

‚ö†Ô∏è *Always do your own research (DYOR) and understand smart contract risks.*

## Ethereum vs Other Layer 1 Chains {#Ethereum-vs-L1}

Despite the rise of L1 competitors like Solana, Avalanche, and BNB Chain, Ethereum remains the most battle-tested and decentralized smart contract platform. Its vast developer base, community, and Layer 2 scaling solutions (like Arbitrum, Optimism) reinforce its dominance.

## Conclusion {#Conclusion}

Ethereum is more than a cryptocurrency‚Äîit‚Äôs the infrastructure behind the decentralized future. With strong utility in DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts, ETH offers both technological significance and long-term investment value. Whether saving or staking, Ethereum plays a key role in building the next generation of the internet.
