## What is Solana? {#What-is-Solana}

Solana (SOL) is a high-performance blockchain known for its fast transactions and low fees. Launched in 2020 by Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana uses a novel consensus called **Proof of History (PoH)** combined with **Proof of Stake (PoS)** to achieve scalability without sacrificing decentralization.

Solana supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), making it a competitor to Ethereum. It's particularly popular for DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 gaming.
